## Web based application to calculate the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) for Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Coral Reefs:

### Introduction

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
Since 2012 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a group of scientific coral reef experts have collaborated to develop a Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) model for the coral reefs of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI)(USEPA, 2021). The BCG is a conceptual framework (Figure 1) that describes how biological attributes of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., biological condition) are expected to change along a gradient of increasing anthropogenic stress (e.g., physical, chemical, and biological impacts)([Santavy et al., 2022a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108805){target="_blank"}).

**BCG Levels** are standardized descriptions of biological condition related to assemblage structure, function, and sensitivity to stressors ([Santavy et al., 2022b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108576){target="_blank"}). *BCG Level 1* (Figure 2, panel 1) describes an assemblage that occurs when human disturbance is entirely or almost entirely absent. This is an undisturbed condition as naturally occurs. *Level 1* conditions are rarely observable in any aquatic environment, especially given ubiquitous stressors introduced by global phenomena such as climate change and atmospheric deposition. *Level 6* conditions assemblages have severely altered structure and function compared to natural expectations (Figure 2, panel 6). *Levels 2 to 5* have successively decreasing resemblance to biological integrity (Figure 2, panel 2-5). *Levels 2-5* are most often observed during BCG calibration exercises. The narrative of the creation process of this conceptual framework is described in detail in [Santavy et al. (2022a)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108805){target="_blank"}. To facilitate the use of the BCG model, a web-based application was developed, which consist of a friendly user interface that allows managers and stakeholders to quickly calculate BCG levels once the field data is made available.

### How to use this app

1.  Upload your data

    The input data for the BCG App must be uploaded using the `BCG_template.xlsx` file available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eisQOkwNLkZh-QOZwfMFq8BeWVAiCGRS?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"}. In this Excel file, there are specific instructions on how to prepare the data.

    Once the data has been arranged in the template, load the file through the file browser in the `Upload your data` tab. You must indicate the type of analysis to be carried out: **BSAT**(Benthic Screening Assessment Tool) or **BCG** (benthic model). The former requires data collected with the Line-Point Intercept (LPI) method. The BCG benthic model needs, in addition to LPI data, demographic data (DEMO) collected on the same LPI transect.

    The data will be previewed for you to verify that it is the correct information. Then you must identify the data column that includes the source of temporal variation (e.g., year, month) and the source of spatial variation (e.g., Region, subregion, site).

2.  Quality control

    After the file is uploaded, it is recommended to run a quality control test on the data from the `Quality control` tab. The most important validation offered by this tool is to verify that all the species reported in the file have BGC attributes and other ecological traits recognized in the [master list](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NK-roMmX4expx41YB1n3LS23rr94RWgf?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}. In case there are species not included in the master list, it is recommended to **request** <url of issues in final GitHub repository> their inclusion to the App administrator before continuing with the analysis. Other quality control evaluations are: spelling of species names, duplicate sample names, empty samples, LPI data fit to 100 point-intercepts.

    The validation of scientific names not included in the master list is verified in [WoRMS](https://marinespecies.org/){target="_blank"}, this procedure may take a few minutes, please be patient and do not start the BCG analysis before the quality control test is finished.

3.  BGC/BSAT analysis

    Go to `BCG results` tab to start the analysis, the results (BSAT or BCG) are summarized in a table for the sources of spatial and temporal variation indicated in step 1. If several sample units were taken as replicates for each source of variation, averages between the samples will be estimated. The details of the BCG analysis (i.e., application of rules to each site) can be downloaded as `.csv` format for further analysis. In addition to the table, the sites are represented in a interactive map, with coloured markers indicating the biological condition of each site.

4.  Other ecological indicators

    In addition to the BCG results, this application processes information of interest to describe the environmental health of the reef described as key indicators in the Coral Reef BCG Model. This information is presented in the "Other indicators" tab, specifically: density of mobile invertebrates, presence of coral bleaching, coral diseases, average living coral cover, vulnerable species, and invasive species.
